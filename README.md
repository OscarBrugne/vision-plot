# VisionPlot
VisionPlot is a modular project combining Pen Plotter, which converts images into line-based vector drawings for physical pen plotting, and Projected Augmented Reality, which uses a projector and camera system to dynamically overlay predefined visuals onto real-world surfaces, all powered by a Process Engine that manages the global logic.
